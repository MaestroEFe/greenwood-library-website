# Capstone Project: Enhanching a community library website (Demo Project)

## Description

This is a demo project for the Capstone Project: Enhanching a community library website (Demo Project). As part of a developement team tasked with enhancing a community library website, we aim to be more engaing and informative for its visitors. It currently includes basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us. My team decided to add a *"Book Reviews"* section and update the *"Events"* page to feature upcoming community events.

This is to simulate the roles of two contributors: *"Morgan"* and *"Jamie"*. Morgan will focus on adding the *"Book Reviews"* section, while Jamie will update the *"Events"* page with new community events.

## Objectives

- Practice cloning a working repository wth branches in Git.
- Gain experience in staging, committing, and pushing changes from both developers.
- Create pull requests and merge them after resolving any potential conflicts between the branches on review.

# Start the Project

## Setup



### Create a new repository

- Navigatge the the GitHub website and create a new repository named *"greenwood-library-website"*.

- Initialize with README.md file

### Clone the repository

 Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/greenwood-library-website.git
```

## Tasks

1. In the main branch, using visual studo code editor ensure there are files for each of the web pages.
    - Home.html
    - About.html
    - Events.html
    - Contact.html

2. Add any random content into each of the files.

3. Stage, commit, and push the changes to the main branch. (This is a simulation of the team's existing codebase for the website.)
